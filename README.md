This dataset encompasses time series data for an unknown physics attractor, showcasing chaotic and complex behavior. It includes 36,700 data points over approximately 28 minutes, each point representing two 2-dimensional spatial coordinates at a specific time. The system periodically resets when entering a loop, offering opportunities to model and predict its chaotic dynamics.
